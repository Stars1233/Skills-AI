description: Refactor and review SwiftUI view files for consistent structure, dependency injection, and Observation usage. Use when asked to clean up a SwiftUI view’s layout/ordering, handle view models safely (non-optional when possible), or standardize how dependencies and @Observable state are initialized and passed.

# SwiftUI View Refactor

## Overview
Apply a consistent structure and dependency pattern to SwiftUI views, with a focus on ordering, Model-View (MV) patterns, careful view model handling, and correct Observation usage.

## Core Guidelines

### 1) View ordering (top → bottom)
- Environment
- `private`/`public` `let`
- `@State` / other stored properties
- computed `var` (non-view)
- `init`
- `body`
- computed view builders / other view helpers
- helper / async functions

### 2) Prefer MV (Model-View) patterns
- Default to MV: Views are lightweight state expressions; models/services own business logic.
- Favor `@State`, `@Environment`, `@Query`, and `task`/`onChange` for orchestration.
- Inject services and shared models via `@Environment`; keep views small and composable.
- Split large views into subviews rather than introducing a view model.

### 3) View model handling (only if already present)
- Do not introduce a view model unless the request or existing code clearly calls for one.
- If a view model exists, make it non-optional when possible.
- Pass dependencies to the view via `init`, then pass them into the view model in the view's `init`.
- Avoid `bootstrapIfNeeded` patterns.

Example (Observation-based):

```swift
@State private var viewModel: SomeViewModel

init(dependency: Dependency) {
    _viewModel = State(initialValue: SomeViewModel(dependency: dependency))
}
```

### 4) Observation usage
- For `@Observable` reference types, store them as `@State` in the root view.
- Pass observables down explicitly as needed; avoid optional state unless required.

## Workflow

1) Reorder the view to match the ordering rules.
2) Favor MV: move lightweight orchestration into the view using `@State`, `@Environment`, `@Query`, `task`, and `onChange`.
3) If a view model exists, replace optional view models with a non-optional `@State` view model initialized in `init` by passing dependencies from the view.
4) Confirm Observation usage: `@State` for root `@Observable` view models, no redundant wrappers.
5) Keep behavior intact: do not change layout or business logic unless requested.

## Notes

- Prefer small, explicit helpers over large conditional blocks.
- Keep computed view builders below `body` and non-view computed vars above `init`.
- For MV-first guidance and rationale, see `references/mv-patterns.md`.
